# Prediction of Diabetes Using Machine Learning
In this project, we build a model in order to detect whether a person has diabetes or not. Depending on many inputs, including blood pressure, pregnancy, glucose, age, and other dependent inputs On machine learning algorithms, where we will build several models and compare them based on several metrics, and in the end We will take the best result


## Methods of dealing with the issue:
### 1-Methods based on machine learning ML:
Machine learning-based methods detect patterns in training data to perform classification and prediction tasks
New data

  Machine learning combines tools from statistics, data mining and optimization to create models.
### 2- Methods based on deep learning DL:

Deep learning-based methods Each layer represents a level of acquired knowledge. Represents the closest class
The input layer represents low-level details of the data, while those closest to the output layer represent a higher level of data
Discrimination in more terms is taking place. (It gives better results on large data)
According to the study [4] to predict diabetes, the following results were obtained:

  1-Methods based on machine learning ML:
  Models trained on datasets achieved almost perfect models.
  
  2-Methods based on deep learning (DL):
  It proved to be suboptimal, despite its ability to handle large data.

##  Machine learning algorithms used:
### 1-Logistic Regression :
### 2-Support Vector Machine (SVM):
### 3-K Nearest Neighbors ( KNN ) :
### 4-Decision Trees  :
### 5-Random Forest( RF ):
### 6-Bayesian Models :

## Evaluation Metrics: 
After training the models, we evaluate the output based on several metrics
The following table shows the results of the algorithms used based on several metrics:

## User Interface :
The user enters the attribute values, which are 8 attributes that include (pregnancy, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, body mass index, diabetes function, and age)
The output is obtained: It includes the patientâ€™s rate of diabetes in addition to the diagnosis of his disease, whether it is safe, risky, or moderate

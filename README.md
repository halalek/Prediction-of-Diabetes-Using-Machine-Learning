# Prediction-of-Diabetes-Using-Machine-Learning
In this project, we build a model in order to detect whether a person has diabetes or not. Depending on many inputs, including blood pressure, pregnancy, glucose, age, and other dependent inputs On machine learning algorithms, where we will build several models and compare them based on several metrics, and in the end We will take the best result
